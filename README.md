# World_Weather_Anaysis

## Overview
This project is to upgrade a completed travel app using google and weather API keys to get current information to include weather condidtions. This will allow users of the app to further filter their preferences of travel destinations. The information was pulled using API keys and added to the completed dataframe as seen here:

## Results
 
An API call using OpenWeatherMap retrieved weather and locations of nearest cities of 2,000 latitdes and longitudes. An API key for google places and maps was used to find the nearest hotel listed in each city and was then added to a map with desired weather and places added to a message box to each marker on the map. Multiple hotel deistinations in China were chosen as an example of the final product. There was also a map of routes to each location in a map as well.

## Summary
The upgrade was a success. The customer has the ability to choose destinations according to their comfort level and have a more enjoyable trip and better prepared trip regarding the weather of their destination. Other possible upgrades may be considered and is dependent on the use of API keys available to web sources that hold current data such as travel costs, food options, transportation options and tourist attractions.
